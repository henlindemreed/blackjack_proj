*Sockets*
This is just the stuff Jim posted on his page

*Src*
Here is where the source code will go. I have created 4 C++ files:

- server_sockets.cc
    which will handle all of the gritty socket stuff
- server_interface.cc
    which will, using server_sockets.cc run the actual game
- client_sockets.cc
    which will handle the (slightly less) gritty socket stuff on the client side
- client_interface.cc
    which will, using client_sockets.cc communicate from the human player to server running the game

There is probably something missing, so feel free to add stuff
